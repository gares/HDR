  abstract  = {This paper provides a gentle introduction to the art of programming type inference with the mechanism of Canonical Structures. Programmable type inference has been one of the key ingredients for the successful formalization of the Odd Order Theorem using the Coq proof assistant. The paper concludes comparing the language of Canonical Structures to the one of Type Classes and Unification Hints.},

  abstract  = {Several mechanisms such as Canonical Structures [14], Type Classes [13,16], or Pullbacks [10] have been recently introduced with the aim to improve the power and flexibility of the type inference algorithm for interactive theorem provers. We claim that all these mechanisms are particular instances of a simpler and more general technique, just consisting in providing suitable hints to the unification procedure underlying type inference. This allows a simple, modular and not intrusive implementation of all the above mentioned techniques, opening at the same time innovative and unexpected perspectives on its possible applications.},

abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept prototype of a (constructive variant of an) HOL interactive theorem prover written in a Higher Order Logic Programming (HOLP) language, namely an extension of λProlog. The prototype is meant to support the claim, that we reinforce, that HOLP is the class of languages that provides the right abstraction level and programming primitives to obtain concise implementations of theorem provers. We identify and advocate for a programming technique, that we call semi-shallow embedding, while at the same time identifying the reasons why pure λProlog is not sufficient to support that technique, and it needs to be extended.},
